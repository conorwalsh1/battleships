# About

Welcome to Ceart (Ceart is the Irish translation of the word 'Correct'), an online multiple choice quiz for kids that tests their knowledge of the Irish language. I set out to create a quiz that is both easy to navigate and clear in it's intent.

As most people who learn the Irish language do so when they are a child, I prioritised a landing page which welcomes the site visitor using clear and easy to read English in a small paragraph with a large button that reads "Start Quiz". The welcome message informs the user that they have ten questions to answer and it also encourages the user to try again if they answer incorrectly. Once the start quiz button is clicked, the welcome message will disappear and the quiz will begin. 

The site user will be asked a question at the top of the screen under which they will have four buttons with each button containing a possible answer. If the correct button is clicked, the button selected will turn green and the "Correct" score tracker will increment by 1, however if they choose incorrectly, the button selected will turn red and the "Incorrect" score tracker will increment by 1 for each wrong answer selected

The quiz is comprised of a total of ten questions with each question being labelled with a number to show the user where they stand in terms of total questions remaining. Once the tenth question has been answered, the quiz area will be cleared of questions and answer buttons and a closing message will inform the user that they have reached the end of the quiz. The closing message will congratulate them on completing the quiz and will ask them how they fared. The user will be informed that if they would like to restart they quiz, they need only click on the little green map of Ireland thaat remains at the top of the page in the logo. Their final scores will be stored at the top of the page, showing how many answers they got correct and how many were answered incorrectly.

This website was built using a Macbook Pro 13". 
    
## Features

-   Responsive on all device sizes. On wider screens the questions and buttons stretch out to make use of space but on smaller screens the media queries ensure the quiz is adaptive and clean

-   Correct and Incorrect scores increment as according to users selecting the correct answer ot incorrect answer.

-   When hovered over, the 'Start Quiz' and 'Next' buttons transition to orange to encourage user to click.

-   Accessibility has been added in terms of both aria labels and aria labelled by to ensure the site is usable for anyone using screen readers.

-   The 'Next' button toggles through questions until there are no questions left to display, at which point the closing message appears on screen.

-   Ten seperate questions with different answers. If the correct answer is selected, button turns green. If incorrect button selected, button turns red.

-   Welcome message upon loading the quiz informing player how the quiz works.

-   Closing message upon completing the quiz congratulating the player, telling them how they scored and directing them to click the green map of Ireland in the logo if they would like to restart. There are four different messages that a player could receive, depending on their final score.

-   The green map of Ireland in the logo contains a link so that when it is clicked, it will refresh the page, thereby restarting the quiz.

## Features To Add In Future

-   Different topics of quiz questions, such as sport, history, geography.

-   Different variations of difficulty to keep site users coming back (perhaps images to accompany certain questions on an easier mode.).

-   A highscore page that stores users names and scores.

-   A timer so that players can test themselves to try and beat their previous times.

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, Samsung 4K Television, iPad, iPhone 7 (Regular and Plus), & iPhoneX.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Known Bugs

-   There are no known bugs at this time.

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
    - Alternatively Click [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/) for a GIF demonstrating the process starting from Step 2.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://github.com) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```

### Acknowledgements

-   I would like to thank my mentor Maria Hynes for guiding me along the right path throughout our mentoring sessions. There were times I struggled with getting the way I wanted the code to look out of my head and onto the screen, but she gave me great motivation to persevere and I am very grateful for her assistance. I would also like to thank the tutors that helped me along the way.

Welcome conorwalsh1,

This is the Code Institute student template for deploying your third portfolio project, the Python command-line project. The last update to this file was: **August 17, 2021**

## Reminders

* Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
* Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
* Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

Happy coding!
